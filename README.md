### What I learned

I was kinda new at using media queries and i was struggling because I was not seeing the content when i was making the screen smaller, and there was a small mistake i made which was using just width instead of max width in container, so one small fix and done! Everything is on the small details we just need to learn to see them. This small projects also help me not forget what i've learned.
